description: Get started with Confident AI for LLM evaluation and observability
---

Evaluate LLM applications of all sorts, with and without code.

## What is Confident AI?

Confident AI is the end-to-end platform for teams to quality-assure their AI applications â€” from RAG pipelines and agentic workflows to chatbots and core LLM models.

**LLM evaluation** allows engineers, QAs, and PMs to:

- Experiment with different versions of prompts and models
- Determine whether your team has introduced any unexpected breaking changes
- Track performance and user satisfaction over time in production
- Include human-in-the-loop to notice what needs to be worked on

<Tip title="Confident AI's evals are 100% powered by DeepEval">
  DeepEval is one of the most widely adopted LLM evaluation framework in the
  world, with over 10k stars and 20 million daily evaluations.

    While DeepEval is like Pytest for LLM apps, Confident AI is the dashboard UI for DeepEval.

- Experiment with different versions of prompts and models
- Determine whether your team has introduced any unexpected breaking changes
- Track performance and user satisfaction over time in production
- Include human-in-the-loop to notice what needs to be worked on

## How LLM evals work

Evaluation on Confident AI has three core components:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="LLM Metrics" icon="chart-line">
    Automates manual pre-deployment AI testing with 40+ LLM-as-a-Judge metrics.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Dataset Curation" icon="file-pen">
    Annotate or generate test datasets prepared by QAs and PMs.
  </Card>
  <Card title="LLM Tracing" icon="code-branch">
    Real-time AI execution observability with performance tracking.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

You don't strictly need to have a dataset coming into Confident AI to start running evals, as you can setup tracing and run evals on the fly instead.

<Note>
  Confident AI supports evals and tracing for any [LLM use
  case](/docs/llm-use-cases), including multi-turn ones.

## FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How is this different from DeepEval?">
    While DeepEval computes the metric results required for data-driven LLM app development, it does not provide the insights required for iteration.

    [Click here](/docs/why-confident-ai#deepeval-vs-confident-ai) for a more comprehensive comparison.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What LLM use cases are supported?">
    All types of LLM use cases are supported, including summarization, Text-SQL, custom support chatbots, internal RAG QAs, conversational agents, etc.

    These use cases can be of any system, including RAG pipelines, agentic workflows, conversational chatbots, or just a combination of everything (e.g. RAG chatbots, agentic RAG).

    Confident AI has tailored metrics and platform capabilities for different types of LLM applications, and it is extremely important to adjust your evaluation strategy depending on your LLM use case. You can read more on the different types of use cases on [this page.](/docs/llm-use-cases)

  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="What about complex agentic systems?">
  Complex agentic systems are definitely supported on Confident AI through [LLM
  tracing.](/docs/llm-tracing/introduction) One thing to note though is that it
  is extremely important to decide carefully on what to (not) evaluate in a
  complex LLM agentic workflow, since trying to evaluate everything means you're
  actually evaluating nothing.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Is Confident AI enterprise ready?">
  Yes, Confident AI offers SSO, data segregation for teams, user roles and
  permissions (with customizations available), and well as the ability to
  self-host in your cloud premises.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What about HIPAA compliance?">
  We're proudly HIPAA compliant and are willing to sign BAAs with customers on
  the [Premium subscription plan or above.](https://confident-ai.com/pricing)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I self-host Confident AI?">
  Yes, while most users are using the SaaS offering, your organization can
  deploy Confident AI in your cloud premises (e.g. AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.)
  through a dockerized manner, which includes integrations with your existing
  identify providers (e.g. Azure AD, Ping, Okta, etc.) of choice for
  authentication into Confident AI platform. In our experience, this process
  takes 1-2 weeks max.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is the pricing?">
    No credit card upfront is required, and we offer transparent pricing with 4 different tiers which includes a generous free tier. You can view the [full pricing here.](https://confident-ai.com/pricing)

    We try to make it sure that you only pay for something once you have had the chance to try it out. If you don't think this is the case, please email support@confident-ai.com and we will make things more generous.
