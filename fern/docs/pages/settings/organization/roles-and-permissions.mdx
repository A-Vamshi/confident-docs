Roles and permissions let you control what each team member can do at the organization level—across projects, billing, SSO, and other org-wide settings.

## Default Roles

Every organization comes with three preset roles:

- **Owner** — Full access to all resources in the organization.
- **Admin** — Can manage members and resources across the organization.
- **Member** — Read and write access to resources they have access to.

## Default Role Permissions

Preset roles include all organization permissions except the following:

- **Owner** — Includes everything (no exclusions).
- **Admin** — Includes everything except `sso:manage` and `billing:manage`. Admins cannot manage SSO or billing settings.
- **Member** — Includes everything except `project:manage`, `organization:manage`, `featureAccess:manage`, `sso:manage`, `apiKey:manage`, `user:manage`, `billing:manage`, `modelCredential:manage`, `modelCost:manage`, `metric:manage`, and `iam:manage`. Members have read access to these areas but cannot change org-wide settings, manage users, or manage roles and policies.

## The project:manage permission

The organization permission **`project:manage`** controls two important behaviors:

1. **Seeing all projects** — Users with `project:manage` can see every project in the organization in the organization projects list. Users without it only see projects they are explicitly members of.
2. **Bypassing project-level checks** — When accessing a project, users with `project:manage` at the organization level bypass that project's role-based permissions. They effectively have full access to the project regardless of their project role. This is how Owners and Admins can access and manage any project in the org.

Owners and Admins have `project:manage` by default. Members do not; custom roles can include or exclude it as needed.

## Custom Roles

You can create custom roles to fit your organization's needs. To create a new role:

1. Navigate to **Organization Settings** → **Roles & Permissions**
2. Click **New Role**
3. Enter a name and description for the role
4. Assign a policy to the role
5. Click **Save**

## Custom Policies

Policies define the specific permissions a role has. Each permission controls access to a particular action at the organization level.

To create a custom policy:

1. Navigate to **Organization Settings** → **Roles & Permissions**
2. Scroll to **Custom Policies** and click **New Policy**
3. Enter a name for the policy
4. Select the permissions you want to include
5. Click **Save**

Once created, you can assign your custom policy to any role.

<Tip>
  Organization roles are separate from project roles. A user's organization role
  applies across the org (billing, SSO, feature access, etc.); their project
  role applies only within each project they belong to—unless they have
  `project:manage`, which lets them access all projects.
</Tip>

## Permission Syntax

Organization permissions follow the same `resource:action` format as project permissions. For example, `billing:read` grants read access to billing info, while `user:manage` allows managing organization users.

**Actions:**

- `read` — View resources or settings
- `manage` — Create, update, or delete (varies by resource)
- `create` — Create new resources (used for `project`)

**Permission resources (organization):**

- `project` — Create projects; `project:manage` also controls visibility of all projects and bypassing project-level permissions (see above)
- `organization` — Organization settings and metadata
- `featureAccess` — Feature flags and plan-based access
- `sso` — SSO providers and configuration
- `apiKey` — Organization API keys
- `user` — Organization user management
- `billing` — Billing and subscription
- `modelCredential`, `modelCost`, `metric` — Org-level model credentials, costs, and metrics
- `iam` — Organization roles and policies

Not every resource has every action. You can see the full list of permissions on the **Roles & Permissions** page in Organization Settings.
