## Overview

The conversation completeness metric is a conversational metric that determines whether your LLM chatbot is able to complete an end-to-end conversation by satisfying user needs throughout a conversation. It is a multi-turn metric that can be used to evaluate if a conversation satisfies a user's needs overall.

<Warning>

The conversation completeness metric can be used as a proxy to measure user satisfaction throughout a conversation. Conversational metrics are particular useful for an LLM chatbot use case.

</Warning>

## How Is It Calculated?

The conversation completeness metric first uses an LLM to extract a list of high level user intentions found in turns (in `user` roles), before using the same LLM to determine whether each intention was met and/or satisfied throughout the conversation by the `assistant`.

$$
\text{Conversation Completeness} = \frac{\text{Number of Satisfied User Intentions in Conversation}}{\text{Total Number of User Intentions in Conversation}}
$$

The final score is the proportion of satisfied user intentions found in the conversation.

## Create Locally

You can create the `ConversationCompletenessMetric` in `deepeval` as follows:

```python
from deepeval.metrics import ConversationCompletenessMetric

metric = ConversationCompletenessMetric()
```

### Optional Parameters

<ParamField path="threshold" type="number" default={0.5}>
    A float to represent the minimum passing threshold.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="model" type="string | Object" default="gpt-4.1">
    A string specifying which of OpenAI's GPT models to use OR any custom LLM model of type [`DeepEvalBaseLLM`](https://deepeval.com/guides/guides-using-custom-llms). 
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="include_reason" type="boolean" default={"true"}>
    A boolean to enable the inclusion a reason for its evaluation score.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="async_mode" type="boolean" default={"true"}>
    A boolean to enable concurrent execution within the `measure()` method.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="strict_mode" type="boolean" default={"false"}>
    A boolean to enforce a binary metric score: 0 for perfection, 1 otherwise.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="verbose_mode" type="boolean" default={"false"}>
    A boolean to print the intermediate steps used to calculate the metric score.
</ParamField>

<Success>
  This can be used for [multi-turn E2E](/docs/llm-evaluation/single-turn/end-to-end)
</Success>

## Create Remotely

For users not using `deepeval` python, or want to run evals remotely on Confident AI, you can use the conversation completeness metric by adding it to a single-turn [metric collection.](/metrics/metric-collections) This will allow you to use conversation completeness metric for:

- Multi-turn E2E testing
- Online and offline evals for traces and spans
