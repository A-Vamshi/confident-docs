## Overview

The knowledge retention metric is a multi-turn metric that is used to evaluate whether your chatbot retains the important information given by the user throughout the conversation. It uses LLM-as-a-judge to check if your chatbot has remembered the information the user has provided until that turn for each interaction.

### Required Parameters

These are the parameters you must supply in your test case to run evaluations for knowledge retention metric:

<ParamField path="turns" type="list of Turn" required>
  A list of `Turn`s as exchanges between user and assistant.
  <Card title="Parameters of `Turn`:">
    ---
    <ParamField path="role" type="user | assistant" required>
      The role of the person speaking, it's either `user` or `assistant`
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField path="content" type="string" required>
      The content provided by the `role` for the turn
    </ParamField>
  </Card>
</ParamField>

## How Is It Calculated?

The knowledge retention metric uses an LLM to extract the information provided in the `content` for all `user` turns. It then uses the same LLM to see if the `assistant` turns have any `content` that doesn't recall infomation.

<br />

$$
\text{Knowledge Retention} = \frac{\text{Number of Assistant Turns without Knowledge Attritions}}{\text{Total Number of Assistant Turns}}
$$

<br />

The final score is the proportion of assisant turns with knowledge attrition found in the conversation.

## Create Locally

You can create the `KnowledgeRetentionMetric` in `deepeval` as follows:

```python
from deepeval.metrics import KnowledgeRetentionMetric

metric = KnowledgeRetentionMetric()
```

### Optional Parameters

<ParamField path="threshold" type="number" default={0.5}>
  A float to represent the minimum passing threshold.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="model" type="string | Object" default="gpt-4.1">
  A string specifying which of OpenAI's GPT models to use OR any custom LLM
  model of type
  [`DeepEvalBaseLLM`](https://deepeval.com/guides/guides-using-custom-llms).
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="include_reason" type="boolean" default={"true"}>
  A boolean to enable the inclusion a reason for its evaluation score.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="async_mode" type="boolean" default={"true"}>
  A boolean to enable concurrent execution within the `measure()` method.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="strict_mode" type="boolean" default={"false"}>
  A boolean to enforce a binary metric score: 0 for perfection, 1 otherwise.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="verbose_mode" type="boolean" default={"false"}>
  A boolean to print the intermediate steps used to calculate the metric score.
</ParamField>

<Success>
  This can be used for [multi-turn
  E2E](/docs/llm-evaluation/single-turn/end-to-end)
</Success>

## Create Remotely

For users not using `deepeval` python, or want to run evals remotely on Confident AI, you can use the knowledge retention metric by adding it to a single-turn [metric collection.](/metrics/metric-collections) This will allow you to use knowledge retention metric for:

- Multi-turn E2E testing
- Online and offline evals for traces and spans
