## Overview

The knowledge retention metric is a conversational metric that determines whether your LLM chatbot is able to retain factual information presented throughout a conversation.

<Warning>

The knowledge retention metric is great for a LLM powered questionnaire use case.

</Warning>

## How Is It Calculated?

The knowledge retention metric uses an LLM to extract knowledge supplied in `content` by the `user` role throughout turns, before using the same LLM to determine whether each corresponding `assistant` content indicates an inability to recall said knowledge.

<br />

$$
\text{Knowledge Retention} = \frac{\text{Number of Assistant Turns without Knowledge Attritions}}{\text{Total Number of Assistant Turns}}
$$

<br />

The final score is the proportion of assisant turns with knowledge attrition found in the conversation.

## Create Locally

You can create the `KnowledgeRetentionMetric` in `deepeval` as follows:

```python
from deepeval.metrics import KnowledgeRetentionMetric

metric = KnowledgeRetentionMetric()
```

### Optional Parameters

  model of type
  [`DeepEvalBaseLLM`](https://deepeval.com/guides/guides-using-custom-llms).
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="include_reason" type="boolean" default={"true"}>
  A boolean to enable the inclusion a reason for its evaluation score.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="async_mode" type="boolean" default={"true"}>
  A boolean to enable concurrent execution within the `measure()` method.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="strict_mode" type="boolean" default={"false"}>
  A boolean to enforce a binary metric score: 0 for perfection, 1 otherwise.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="verbose_mode" type="boolean" default={"false"}>

</ParamField>

<Success>
  This can be used for [multi-turn
  E2E](/docs/llm-evaluation/single-turn/end-to-end)
</Success>

## Create Remotely

For users not using `deepeval` python, or want to run evals remotely on Confident AI, you can use the knowledge retention metric by adding it to a single-turn [metric collection.](/metrics/metric-collections) This will allow you to use knowledge retention metric for:

- Multi-turn E2E testing
- Online and offline evals for traces and spans
