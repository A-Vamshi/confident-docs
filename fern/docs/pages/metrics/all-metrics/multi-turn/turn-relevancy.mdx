## Overview

The turn relevancy metric is a conversational metric that determines whether your LLM chatbot is able to consistently generate relevant responses throughout a conversation.

## How Is It Calculated?

The turn relevancy metric first constructs a sliding windows of turns for each turn, before using an LLM to determine whether the last turn in each sliding window has an `assistant` content that is relevant to the previous conversational context found in the sliding window.

<br />

$$
\text{Turn Relevancy} = \frac{\text{Number of Assistant Turns with Relevant Assistant Content}}{\text{Total Number of Assistant Turns}}
$$

<br />

The final score is the proportion of assisant turns that give relevant output in the conversation.

## Create Locally

You can create the `TurnRelevancyMetric` in `deepeval` as follows:

```python
from deepeval.metrics import TurnRelevancyMetric

metric = TurnRelevancyMetric()
```

### Optional Parameters

<ParamField path="threshold" type="number" default={0.5}>
  A float to represent the minimum passing threshold.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="window_size" type="number" default={10}>
  An integer which defines the size of the sliding window of turns used during
  evaluation.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="model" type="string | Object" default="gpt-4.1">
  A string specifying which of OpenAI's GPT models to use OR any custom LLM
  model of type
  [`DeepEvalBaseLLM`](https://deepeval.com/guides/guides-using-custom-llms).
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="include_reason" type="boolean" default={"true"}>
  A boolean to enable the inclusion a reason for its evaluation score.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="async_mode" type="boolean" default={"true"}>
  A boolean to enable concurrent execution within the `measure()` method.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="strict_mode" type="boolean" default={"false"}>
  A boolean to enforce a binary metric score: 0 for perfection, 1 otherwise.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="verbose_mode" type="boolean" default={"false"}>
  A boolean to print the intermediate steps used to calculate the metric score.
</ParamField>

<Success>
  This can be used for [multi-turn
  E2E](/docs/llm-evaluation/single-turn/end-to-end)
</Success>

## Create Remotely

For users not using `deepeval` python, or want to run evals remotely on Confident AI, you can use the turn relevancy metric by adding it to a single-turn [metric collection.](/metrics/metric-collections) This will allow you to use turn relevancy metric for:

- Multi-turn E2E testing
- Online and offline evals for traces and spans
