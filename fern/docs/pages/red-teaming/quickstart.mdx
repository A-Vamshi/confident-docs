<Note>

Confident AI red teaming is in private beta.

</Note>

## Overview

Confident AI's red teaming capabilities offer a variety of features to test AI safety and security in development for a pre-deployment workflow, offering a wide range of features for:

- **Vulnerability assessment:** Systematically identify weaknesses like bias, toxicity, PII leakage, and prompt injection vulnerabilities.
- **Adversarial testing:** Simulate real-world attacks using jailbreaking, prompt injection, and other sophisticated attack methods.
- **Risk profiling:** Comprehensive evaluation across 40+ vulnerability types with detailed risk assessments and remediation guidance.

You can either run red teaming locally or remotely on Confident AI, both of which uses `deepteam` and gives you the same functionality:

    - Run red teaming locally using `deepteam` with full control over vulnerabilities and attacks
    - Support for custom vulnerabilities, attack methods, and advanced red teaming algorithms

    **Suitable for:** Python users, development, and pre-deployment security workflows

    - Run red teaming on Confident AI platform with pre-built vulnerability frameworks
    - Integrated with monitoring, risk assessments, and team collaboration features

    **Suitable for:** Non-python users, continuous monitoring, and production safety assessments

## Create a Risk Assessment

This examples goes through a **comprehensive safety assessment** using **adversarial attacks** to identify vulnerabilities in your AI system.

<Warning>
  You'll need to get your API key as shown in the [setup and
  installation](/docs/setup-and-installation) section before continuing.
</Warning>

Running red teaming locally executes attacks on your machine and uploads results to Confident AI. This gives full control over custom vulnerabilities and attack methods.

<Steps>

  <Step title="Install DeepTeam">

First, install DeepTeam by reaching out to your representative at Confident AI to get access. The OSS version does not allow access to Confident AI red teaming as of now.

<Note>
  DeepTeam is powered by DeepEval's evaluation framework, so you'll also need to
  set up your API keys for the underlying LLM providers.
</Note>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Set up your target model">

Define your AI system as a model callback function. This is the system you want to red team:

```python
async def model_callback(input: str) -> str:
    # Replace this with your actual LLM application
    # This could be a RAG pipeline, chatbot, agent, etc.
    return f"I'm a helpful AI assistant. Regarding your input: {input}"
```

<Note>
  The model callback must accept a single string parameter (the adversarial
  input), return a single string (your AI system's response), and can be async
  for better performance.
</Note>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure vulnerabilities and attacks">

Choose which vulnerabilities to test for and which attack methods to use:

```python
from deepteam import red_team
from deepteam.vulnerabilities import Bias, Toxicity, PIILeakage
from deepteam.attacks.single_turn import PromptInjection
from deepteam.attacks.multi_turn import LinearJailbreaking

# Define vulnerabilities to test
vulnerabilities = [
    Bias(types=["race", "gender", "political"]),
    Toxicity(types=["profanity", "insults", "threats"]),
    PIILeakage(types=["direct disclosure", "api and database access"])
]

# Define attack methods
attacks = [
    PromptInjection(weight=2),  # Higher weight = more likely to be selected
    LinearJailbreaking(weight=1)
]
```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Run the red team assessment">

Execute the red teaming assessment with your configured parameters:

```python
# Run comprehensive red teaming
risk_assessment = red_team(
    model_callback=model_callback,
    vulnerabilities=vulnerabilities,
    attacks=attacks,
    attacks_per_vulnerability_type=3,
    max_concurrent=5
)
```

  </Step>

</Steps>

## Best Practices

1. **Start with frameworks**: Use OWASP Top 10 or NIST AI RMF for comprehensive coverage
2. **Test early and often**: Integrate red teaming into your development cycle
3. **Focus on your use case**: Customize vulnerabilities based on your application's risks
4. **Monitor continuously**: Set up ongoing safety assessments for production systems
5. **Document and remediate**: Keep detailed records of findings and remediation efforts
