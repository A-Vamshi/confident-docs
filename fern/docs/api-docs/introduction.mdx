Confident AI enables organizations to offload evaluations, tracing, dataset management, and prompt versioning via a comprehensive **RESTFUL Evals API**.

Whether you're evaluating LLM outputs in production or integrating directly with [DeepEval](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval), the platform supports a multi-tenant structure for clean project-level isolation and scalability.

## Installation

You can interact with our API through HTTP or Websocket requests from any langauage. However, if you would like to use our official python or typescript SDK, just install them using the following command:

<CodeBlocks>
  ```bash title="Python"
    pip install -U deepeval
  ```
  ```bash title="Typescript"
    npm install deepeval-ts
  ```
</CodeBlocks>

## FAQs

<AccordionGroup>

    <Accordion title="How the Evals API different from DeepEval?">

    The Evals API provides more low-level control over the DeepEval client and provide benefits that DeepEval alone doesn't offer:

    **Managed Infrastructure**: Serverless evaluations on our managed servers, error handling for metric failures and retries, cost management and billing optimization, automatic scaling based on evaluation volume. 

    **Platform Dashboard**: Visual results for each customer dataset, historical tracking and trends, team collaboration features, custom analytics dashboards.

    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How is the Evals API different from using the platform?">

    The Evals API and platform serve different use cases in your LLM application development workflow:

    **Platform (Dashboard)**: Use when your engineering teams need to improve an LLM application. It provides visual test case creation, interactive evaluation results, team collaboration features, and built-in dashboards.

    **Evals API**: Use when building an LLM application that needs to automate evaluations for different customers, run evaluations programmatically, build custom dashboards, integrate into existing workflows, or scale across multiple customer environments.

    Both approaches use the same underlying evaluation engine, so you can start with the platform for development and use the API for production automation.

    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Who is this for?">

    1. Organizations that need to **scale evaluations across multiple customers or environments** while maintaining visibility into results.
    2. Users that aren't working with Python or Typescript. If users are working with either Python or Typescript, using DeepEval as your client library is highly recommended.
